					Anmo is a mobile annotation web-application built for Mobile Firefox running on the Nokia N900 handset. It allows users to highlight, star, and write notes on web pages, and offers the ability to toggle between annotate and review modes. Annotations are stored in the cloud using App Engine. Anmo was a class final project in collaboration with <a href="http://www.alisonmeier.com/Alison_Meier/Home.html">Alison Meir</a> and <a href="http://www.voytekdesign.com/">Jessica Voytek</a>. “The mobile web annotation project caught my eye as well. This was a prototype based on Firefox for Mobile (who knew?) that allowed people to highlight passages of web pages they were reading. Unlike some other annotation tools, this one made it possible to toggle between the annotated passages and the full document.” —FXPAL blog from FX Palo Alto Laboratory
