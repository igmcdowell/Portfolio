			Emlo the "tangible broadcast buddy," is a prototype device for broadcasting your current emotion from a given location. User gestures are translated into a corresponding emotion, which is then posted (in combination with the user's location) to Twitter. Emlo was a class final project in collaboration with <a href="http://www.alisonmeier.com/Alison_Meier/Portfolio.html">Alison Meir</a> and <a href="http://www.voytekdesign.com/">Jessica Voytek</a>.

		<p>Emlo was born out of an interest to explore gestural expression of emotion. After brainstorming different methods of exploring this question, we settled on the idea of a digital pet able to relay how its master is feeling. To inform our design, we started with a small number of exploratory <strong>interviews</strong>, and used the output to produce a close-ended <strong>survey</strong>.
			</p>
			<h2>Interviews</h2>
			<p>Six participants were individually interviewed and asked to model each of eight basic emotions using provided materials with different physical properties (below). The gestures and materials used were recorded and clustered. Ten distinct gestures were identified, which served as the basis for a follow-on survey.</p>

			<h2>Survey</h2> 
			<p>We created a clay prototype and used it to demonstrate each gesture identified in the exploratory interviews in a series of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV7p-Sie1IY">short video clips</a>. We incorporated these in an <a href="http://polldaddy.com/s/8507DE474270E922">online survey</a> asking users to map each of the eight emotions to one gesture (some gestures were left over). The 35 responses showed strongest agreement in gesture/emotion mappings for anger, sadness, joy, and surprise.</p>

		<h2>Hardware:</h2>
		<p>The class focused on the Arduino Duemilanove microcontroller, which we used as the base of our stack. We then took the top four emotion/gesture pairs from our research and figured out how to model them with off-the-shelf sensors.</p>
		<h2>Software:</h2>
		<p> We chose Twitter for a broadcast platform to take advantage of its easy and robust API. Reverse-geocoding coordinates was accomplished using the Google Maps API. We also wanted some additional functionality, including user-customizable labels for emotions and locations, and a "listen" mode where Emlo receives and relays data from other virtual Emlo devices. Google App Engine served as the middle layer handling these tasks. </p>

				Emlo Components and Responsibilities (lead developer in bold):
				<ul>
					<li>Sensor Housing - Emlo's body (<strong>Jessica</strong>, Alison)

					<li>Arduino Sensors and Code - The guts and brains of Emlo, built using an Arduino Duemilanove with flex sensor, force sensor, and photo sensor (Guts: <strong>Alison</strong>, Brains: <strong>Alison</strong>, Ian)
					</li>
					<li>Python glue code - Local machine code for translating the Arduino serial input into HTTP Requests for the App Engine Back End. (<strong>Ian</strong>)
					</li>
					<li>App Engine Back End - Used to store user messages, store per-user associations between gestures/locations and plain English names, reverse code geodata using the Google Maps API, call the Twitter API, and host the administrator front end. (<strong>Ian</strong>)
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://emloapp.appspot.com/">App Engine Front End</a> - Administrator controls for managing descriptions of locations and gestures to be used in posted tweets. Also includes tool for generating fake tweets for demonstration purposes. (<strong>Ian</strong>)

		<p>Emlo was well received by the class and school community; The final grade for the project was an 'A+', Emlo was featured on the front page of the I School website, and asked to re-appear at several community I School recruiting events.

			<p>The <a href="http://emloapp.appspot.com">administrator controls</a> are still accessible on App Engine, and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ianemlo">several</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/alisonemlo">Emlo</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jessicaemlo">profiles</a> on Twitter. However, changes to the Twitter API since the original project was completed have broken tweet generation functionality. Emlo source code is available on request.
