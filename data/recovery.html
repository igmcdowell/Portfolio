		<p>The <a href="http://recovery.berkeley.edu">recovery.berkeley.edu</a> site is a project by <a href="http://isd.ischool.berkeley.edu/person/ekansa">Eric Kansa</a>, <a href="http://dret.net/netdret/">Erik Wilde</a>, and <a href="http://www.raymondyee.net/">Raymond Yee</a>, a group of professors and lecturers at the <a href="http://ischool.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley School of Information</a>. My role was to design and build the site, write some of the content, and generate example data for some of the technical demonstrations. This was a paid contract position from 2009. Complete source code is available on request.</p>

	<div id="planning" class="section-content">
		<p>This site was intended as a response to quick-moving political changes from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Given the quick time-table, planning activities were limited to stylistic consultation and a quick card sort for organizing site content.</p>
		<h2>Visual Design Inputs</h2>
		<p>The grant for the project originated from the <a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com">Sunlight Foundation</a>. My employers wanted to evoke the feel of the sponsoring site, though not making it so similar as to confuse visitors.</p><p>I was also instructed to base my design off of <a href="http://www.freecsstemplates.org/preview/zenlike">this</a> free template, in the interest of saving time.</p>

			<h2>Content Organization</h2>
			<p>A list of specific pages to include on the site was dictated by my employers. I conducted card sort asking volunteers to group related concepts. I used the most common groupings to layout the page hierarchy.</p>
