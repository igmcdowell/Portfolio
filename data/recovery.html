		<p>The <a href="http://recovery.berkeley.edu">recovery.berkeley.edu</a> site is a project by <a href="http://isd.ischool.berkeley.edu/person/ekansa">Eric Kansa</a>, <a href="http://dret.net/netdret/">Erik Wilde</a>, and <a href="http://www.raymondyee.net/">Raymond Yee</a>, a group of professors and lecturers at the <a href="http://ischool.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley School of Information</a>. My role was to design and build the site, write some of the content, and generate example data for some of the technical demonstrations. This was a paid contract position from 2009. Complete source code is available on request.</p>

	<div id="planning" class="section-content">
		<p>This site was intended as a response to quick-moving political changes from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Given the quick time-table, planning activities were limited to stylistic consultation and a quick card sort for organizing site content.</p>
		<h2>Visual Design Inputs</h2>
		<p>The grant for the project originated from the <a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com">Sunlight Foundation</a>. My employers wanted to evoke the feel of the sponsoring site, though not making it so similar as to confuse visitors.</p><p>I was also instructed to base my design off of <a href="http://www.freecsstemplates.org/preview/zenlike">this</a> free template, in the interest of saving time.</p>

			<h2>Content Organization</h2>
			<p>A list of specific pages to include on the site was dictated by my employers. I conducted card sort asking volunteers to group related concepts. I used the most common groupings to layout the page hierarchy.</p>

	<div id="development" class="section-content">
		<p>In addition to <strong>building the actual site</strong>, I was also asked to <strong>generate XML files</strong> for use as input into demonstration sites, and to <strong>write background information</strong> for the site.</p>
		<h2>Site Development</h2>
		<p>The recovery.berkeley.edu site was built using HTML, CSS, and limited PHP for the contact form. Source code was written in VI and tracked through <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>.</p>
		<h2>XML Generation</h2>
		<p>I used Python in combination with several APIs to generate several hundred XML formatted fake addresses with valid geo-location and postal code information. These addresses were then used as part of a second script to generate fake government contracts formatted in XML complying to government specifications. This process involved analyzing government standard documents to ensure that my example data conformed to standards and maintained proper relationships between entities.</p>
		<h2>Copywriting</h2>
		<p>Before I could contribute meaningful text to the site I had to get up to speed on the issues. I spent the first day reading academic reports and familiarizing myself with the underlying technologies and issues. Once up to speed, I filled in the major background information on the site; the resulting output was 4,000 words of content that served as a base for all future revisions.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="results" class="section-content">
		<p>The underlying website structure plus 4,000 words of content was completed within one week. Additional research and development for the XML generation was completed in another five days. The <a href="http://recovery.berkeley.edu">recovery.berkeley.edu</a> site went live at the end of August 2009. The clients were very satisfied with my communication, timeline and quality of work.</p>
