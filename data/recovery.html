		<p>The <a href="http://recovery.berkeley.edu">recovery.berkeley.edu</a> site is a project by <a href="http://isd.ischool.berkeley.edu/person/ekansa">Eric Kansa</a>, <a href="http://dret.net/netdret/">Erik Wilde</a>, and <a href="http://www.raymondyee.net/">Raymond Yee</a>, a group of professors and lecturers at the <a href="http://ischool.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley School of Information</a>. My role was to design and build the site, write some of the content, and generate example data for some of the technical demonstrations. This was a paid contract position from 2009. Complete source code is available on request.</p>
