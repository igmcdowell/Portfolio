# About
This is an interactive portfolio showcasing some of the projects I worked on in my masters program at UC Berkeley. It is intended to run on a cheap webhost with no server-side logic, while still supporting variable layouts for different devices (e.g. smartphone, ipad), and some lazy loading.

A live version is hosted at http://squidproco.com/portfolio
